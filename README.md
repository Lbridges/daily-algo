Daily study of machine learning algorithms

## I want to make robots...

So, I'm going to need to know a bit more about data-structures and algorithms. I recently stumbled upon some good advice on how to learn algorithms -in the form of a tweet from Andrew Trask:
> 1. Find an implementation
> 2. Strip it down to absolute bare bones
> 3. Teach it, line-by-line, in a blog

### This is where I will document my best efforts in following that advice
