<em>This is more for my personal sense of organization, rather than anything official.</em>

<p>I am typically a little scatter-brained, and I tend to bite off more than I can chew. I have unfinished works from paintings to books -a massive "blob", if you will. Now is the time I have designated to review my past impulses, pluck the needles from the haystacks, and secure a focus for development.</p>

<p>While I am interested in the massive amounts of other people's data floating around out there, the draw isn't nearly as strong as my own data. I want to train neural networks on my images -drawings, paintings, graphics, and photographs. I want to train neural networks on my audio clips, my writing samples ...everything about myself that I can represent digitally.</p>

<strong>To render what?</strong>
<em>Any and everything I can</em>

<strong>What is the point? </strong>
<em>I would be creating a model other people can use on their own data</em>

<strong>Is there a market for that?</strong> 
<em>Who cares</em>
